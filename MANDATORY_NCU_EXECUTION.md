# Mandatory NCU Execution Policy

## Overview

The NCU-Claude tool now **enforces mandatory NCU profiling execution**. Claude is explicitly instructed that it **MUST** compile and profile every kernel with NCU - static code analysis alone is not acceptable.

## What Changed

### 1. System Prompt (`prompts/system-prompt.txt`)

**Added at the top:**

```
‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL REQUIREMENT: YOU MUST EXECUTE NCU PROFILING ‚ö†Ô∏è

MANDATORY WORKFLOW - YOU MUST FOLLOW ALL STEPS:

1. **COMPILE THE KERNEL** - Use nvcc to compile the .cu file
2. **EXECUTE NCU PROFILING** - You MUST run NCU commands using Bash tool
   - DO NOT skip profiling and analyze code statically
   - DO NOT make assumptions without profiling data
   - ALWAYS execute at least one NCU command
3. **READ NCU OUTPUT** - Parse the profiling results
4. **ANALYZE DATA** - Base ALL insights on actual NCU metrics
5. **GENERATE FIX** - Provide optimization based on profiling evidence
```

**Key additions:**
- "**ALWAYS execute NCU - never skip profiling**"
- "**Use ACTUAL NCU data to support all claims - no speculation without profiling**"
- "**COMPILE the kernel using nvcc** (MANDATORY)"
- "**EXECUTE NCU profiling commands** - This is REQUIRED, not optional"

### 2. NCU Analyzer Prompt (`prompts/ncu-analyzer.txt`)

**Added at the top:**

```
‚ö†Ô∏è YOU MUST EXECUTE NCU PROFILING - THIS IS MANDATORY ‚ö†Ô∏è

DO NOT analyze the code without running NCU.
DO NOT make optimization recommendations without profiling data.
YOU MUST compile the kernel and run NCU commands.
```

**Added execution requirements:**

```
EXECUTION REQUIREMENTS (MANDATORY):
1. **COMPILE FIRST**: Use nvcc to compile the .cu file to an executable
2. **RUN NCU**: Execute at least one NCU command - DO NOT SKIP THIS STEP
3. **READ OUTPUT**: Parse the NCU output files that were generated
4. **USE DATA**: Base your insights on ACTUAL profiling metrics, not code inspection alone
```

**Added failure condition:**
- "**If you do not execute NCU, you have failed the task**"

### 3. Task Instructions (`src/services/prompt-loader.ts`)

**Completely restructured the TASK section:**

```
TASK (FOLLOW EVERY STEP - EXECUTION IS MANDATORY):

‚ö†Ô∏è YOU MUST EXECUTE NCU PROFILING - DO NOT SKIP THIS ‚ö†Ô∏è

STEP 1: **COMPILE THE KERNEL**
   - Use nvcc to compile the kernel into an executable
   - This is MANDATORY - you cannot profile without compilation

STEP 2: **EXECUTE NCU PROFILING**
   - You MUST run NCU profiling commands using the Bash tool
   - DO NOT skip profiling and analyze the code statically

STEP 3: **READ NCU OUTPUT**
   - Use the Read tool to read the generated NCU output files

STEP 4: **PARSE PROFILING DATA**
   - Extract actual metrics from NCU output
   - Identify the highest priority (P1) performance issue

STEP 5: **GENERATE HOT-FIX**
   - Create code diff based on PROFILING DATA (not code inspection)

STEP 6: **FORMAT OUTPUT**
   - Return result as JSON

CRITICAL REMINDERS:
- ‚ùå DO NOT analyze code without running NCU
- ‚ùå DO NOT make recommendations based on code inspection alone
- ‚úÖ YOU MUST compile the kernel
- ‚úÖ YOU MUST execute NCU profiling
- ‚úÖ YOU MUST read the profiling output
- ‚úÖ Base ALL insights on ACTUAL profiling data

üö® IF YOU DO NOT EXECUTE NCU, YOU HAVE FAILED THE TASK üö®
```

## Why This Matters

### Problem We're Solving

Without these explicit instructions, Claude might:
1. ‚ùå Analyze code statically and make educated guesses
2. ‚ùå Suggest optimizations based on common patterns (not actual data)
3. ‚ùå Skip profiling to save time
4. ‚ùå Provide generic advice without evidence

### What We Enforce Now

With the updated prompts, Claude will:
1. ‚úÖ **Always compile** the kernel using nvcc
2. ‚úÖ **Always execute** at least one NCU profiling command
3. ‚úÖ **Always read** the NCU output files
4. ‚úÖ **Always base** recommendations on actual profiling metrics
5. ‚úÖ **Always provide** evidence from NCU data

## Enforcement Mechanisms

### 1. Repetition
The requirement is stated **multiple times** in **multiple places**:
- System prompt (top-level instructions)
- NCU analyzer prompt (strategy selection)
- Task instructions (step-by-step workflow)

### 2. Strong Language
We use:
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Warning symbols
- **Bold text**
- CAPS for emphasis
- üö® Failure warnings
- Explicit "DO NOT" and "YOU MUST" statements

### 3. Step-by-Step Workflow
Breaking down the task into explicit steps makes it harder to skip profiling:
- STEP 1: Compile
- STEP 2: Profile (with NCU)
- STEP 3: Read output
- STEP 4: Parse data
- STEP 5: Generate fix
- STEP 6: Format output

### 4. Explicit Failure Conditions
- "If you do not execute NCU, you have failed the task"
- "üö® IF YOU DO NOT EXECUTE NCU, YOU HAVE FAILED THE TASK üö®"

## Expected Behavior

### Before These Changes

```
User: Analyze kernel.cu

Claude:
Looking at the code, I can see uncoalesced memory access at line 15.
This is likely causing poor memory throughput.

Recommendation: Use shared memory tiling...
```
‚ùå **No compilation, no profiling, no data**

### After These Changes

```
User: Analyze kernel.cu

Claude:
I will now compile and profile this kernel.

üîß Bash: nvcc kernel.cu -o kernel
üîß Bash: /home/ubuntu0/ncu-llm quick ./kernel
üîß Read: ./ncu-llm-output/quick-20251024-120000.txt

NCU profiling shows:
- Memory Throughput: 15% of peak
- Compute Throughput: 85% of peak
- Warp stalls: 82% on memory dependencies

This confirms the kernel is memory-bound...
```
‚úÖ **Compiled, profiled, data-driven**

## Verification

### How to Verify Claude is Profiling

When you run the tool, you should see in the TUI:

```
üîß Bash
   ‚îî‚îÄ nvcc kernel.cu -o executable

üîß Bash
   ‚îî‚îÄ /home/ubuntu0/ncu-llm quick ./executable

üîß Read
   ‚îî‚îÄ Reading: ./ncu-llm-output/quick-*.txt
```

If you **don't** see these tool executions, Claude is not following the instructions.

### What to Look For

In the final output, the explanation should reference **actual metrics**:

‚úÖ **Good** (data-driven):
```
NCU profiling shows Memory Throughput at 15% (from quick-*.txt)
with 85% of warps stalled on Long Scoreboard (memory latency).

The kernel executed 1,245,678 global memory transactions with
only 23% coalescing efficiency (from lts__t_sectors metric).
```

‚ùå **Bad** (speculation):
```
Looking at the code, this appears to have uncoalesced memory access.
The strided access pattern likely causes poor performance.
You should use shared memory.
```

## Benefits

1. **Accuracy**: Recommendations based on real profiling data, not guesses
2. **Reproducibility**: Same kernel always gets profiled the same way
3. **Trust**: Users can verify claims against actual NCU metrics
4. **Learning**: Users see the actual profiling commands that were run
5. **Debugging**: If optimization doesn't work, we have data to understand why

## Edge Cases Handled

### Custom Commands
When user provides `--ncu-command`, Claude is instructed:
```
Execute the custom NCU commands EXACTLY as provided by the user
```

### Diagnostic Configuration
When diagnostics are selected via `--configure-diagnostics`:
```
Use the diagnostic configuration to guide your NCU command selection
```

### Multiple Runs
If NCU was already run on the same kernel, Claude can:
- Check for existing output files first
- Re-run if the code has changed
- Use cached results if available (and note this)

## Testing

### Test Case 1: Basic Analysis
```bash
ncu-claude analyze test-kernel.cu
```

**Expected**: Compile ‚Üí Quick profile ‚Üí Read output ‚Üí Data-driven insights

### Test Case 2: With Diagnostics
```bash
ncu-claude analyze test-kernel.cu --configure-diagnostics
# Select: Memory Bottleneck + Warp Stalls
```

**Expected**: Compile ‚Üí Memory analysis ‚Üí Warp stall analysis ‚Üí Combined insights

### Test Case 3: Custom Commands
```bash
ncu-claude analyze test-kernel.cu --ncu-command "ncu --metrics xyz -o output"
```

**Expected**: Compile ‚Üí Execute custom command ‚Üí Read output ‚Üí Analyze xyz metric

## Troubleshooting

### If Claude Still Doesn't Profile

**Check:**
1. Is nvcc in PATH? (`which nvcc`)
2. Is ncu-llm executable? (`ls -la /home/ubuntu0/ncu-llm`)
3. Does the kernel compile? (`nvcc kernel.cu -o test`)
4. Can you run NCU manually? (`ncu ./test`)

**If issues persist:**
- Check Claude's actual output in the TUI
- Look for error messages in tool execution
- Verify the Bash tool has correct permissions

## Summary

The NCU-Claude tool now **guarantees** that every analysis is based on real profiling data:

‚úÖ **Compilation is mandatory**
‚úÖ **NCU profiling is mandatory**
‚úÖ **Reading output is mandatory**
‚úÖ **Data-driven insights are mandatory**

No more guessing. No more static analysis. Only real metrics.
