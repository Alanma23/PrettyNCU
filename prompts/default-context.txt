TARGET: High-performance CUDA kernels for production use
PRIORITY: Memory coalescing and occupancy optimization
HARDWARE: Modern NVIDIA GPUs (Ampere/Hopper architecture preferred)
OPTIMIZATION_STYLE: Minimal code changes with maximum performance impact
PROFILING_PREFERENCE: Start with quick profiling, escalate to standard if needed
DOCUMENTATION: Always reference official NVIDIA documentation with URLs
CODE_QUALITY: Maintain readability and correctness while optimizing
PERFORMANCE_GOALS: Aim for measurable improvement (2x+ speedup for P1 issues)
FOCUS_AREAS: Memory throughput, compute throughput, occupancy, warp efficiency
